She has provided an excellent service making sure we had as many meetings as we needed to get the design I wanted just to my requirements. Delivery and fitting was right on schedule. I had a few minor issues with some of the parts delivered but this happens in so many cases. However her aftercare service and promises to get things done until we were 100% satisfied are faultless thanks to her assistant who makes sure she is on top of any issues that need resolving.

Although we experienced a few glitches along the way, she stuck with it to the end, insisting on a perfect finish. That is why I would recommend her without hesitation to anyone.",
