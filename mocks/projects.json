She has provided an excellent service making sure we had as many meetings as we needed to get the design I wanted just to my requirements. Delivery and fitting was right on schedule. I had a few minor issues with some of the parts delivered but this happens in so many cases. However her aftercare service and promises to get things done until we were 100% satisfied are faultless thanks to her assistant who makes sure she is on top of any issues that need resolving.

Kati’s input into the design process was personal and thoughtful. Throughout the project she was available and attentive. Although we experienced a few glitches along the way, she stuck with it to the end, insisting on a perfect finish. That is why I would recommend her without hesitation to anyone.",
